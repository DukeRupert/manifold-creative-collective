title: The Dice Society
bio: |-
  I’m Caio, a programmer from Brazil with a passion for tabletop RPGs. I made this blog to share DM advice, the history of my homebrew world, and interesting stuff I create on the intersection between technology and games. Currently, it serves mostly as the home for The Dice Society podcast.

  Who knows what it will be in the future…
