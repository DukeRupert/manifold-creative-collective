# James Introcaso on Becoming a Professional Designer | Insight Check Episode 5

_This interview was conducted as a gift for the Manifold Creator Collective, a group of designers working on Draw Steel products. James Introcaso discusses his early career and how he broke into the TTRPG industry, offering valuable insights for aspiring designers._

## Introduction

Hey folks! I've got a very special Insight Check for you. Some friends and I recently formed a Draw Steel creators collective called the Manifold - just a loose collective of folks working together to make the best Draw Steel products we can. This interview was made with the Manifold in mind as a gift for the group. James agreed to discuss his early career with me and how he broke into the industry. I think the discussion led to a lot of helpful insights for people who also want to make a career out of TTRPG design. I know I certainly learned a lot.

Speaking of the Manifold Creator Collective, regular viewers may have noticed the new look to these interviews and thumbnails. These templates were made by someone I met through the MCC, Mr. Matt Dollar. Matt does graphic design and professional layout. I've linked some of their work in the description - check it out if it interests you. I'm sure I will be working with them a lot in the future.

Before jumping into the interview, I also want to apologize and give a quick disclaimer: I had some audio quality issues in this one that I've never really encountered before at this level. Of course, I tried my best to fix them, but I am still learning this stuff, and the result is audio quality when James is speaking that is definitely below the standard that I want or I'm proud of. I almost didn't release this video at all, but James said so many insightful things in the interview I ultimately decided it wouldn't be fair to him if I didn't. So I'm sorry - I hope you'll be patient with me. My audio is usually better than this.

## The Interview

**Host:** We are joined now by James Introcaso. James is a senior designer at MCDM and the current lead on Draw Steel. In this interview, we will be talking about his career working in the tabletop RPG space. James has been on this podcast many times, so I recommend you check out those other interviews that we've done. James, welcome back!

**James:** Hey, thank you so much for having me. I love being here and love chatting with you, so this is going to be a fun time.

**Host:** I'm really excited for this one. Just to let the audience know the plan for this interview - I reached out to James a while back because some friends and I had just started a community of people looking to make third-party products for Draw Steel when it finally releases. When you're doing any kind of creative work, I think it is really tough to do it solo, and we wanted to band together. There was a lot of energy with all of us talking about making Draw Steel products, and there's always the hope (speaking for myself and I'm sure many others) that this could go somewhere and potentially turn into a career making products for tabletop games.

Of course, you can never expect that because it's a very niche field, but it occurred to me that James was once like us - someone who wanted to break into the field of tabletop RPG design. You did it when D&D 5th Edition was just releasing, just like we're trying to do now with Draw Steel releasing. I thought it would be really cool to talk to you about how you got your break, how your career started, and that might have some insights for all of us about how we could maybe do the same thing for Draw Steel.

**James:** Absolutely! I'm so excited to talk about this. A big thing for me is that I want Draw Steel to be something that third-party creators enjoy making stuff for and enjoy being part of a community for, because that was a big part of me getting my start - finding friends and working with a great community of 5E creators. We don't have the audience that 5E has, but we have the power to empower creators and foster those folks in ways that a big company like Hasbro may not.

One thing we want to do is make sure we're telling you as much as we can and giving you the tools to create really cool stuff for Draw Steel. Part of that is also having this conversation. My hat is off to the fact that there is already a community of creators for a game that hasn't actually officially released yet. That's amazing to me, because that's how I started - I started making stuff for 5E before the actual official release of 5E because there were public playtests.

## The Epoch Change of D&D 5E

**Host:** I'm really excited to talk to you about that. It's such an interesting time in history for me as well because 5E has obviously become such a landmark edition in Dungeons & Dragons history. But in the buildup to its release, it seemed like Wizards of the Coast and D&D was still losing a lot of customers to Pathfinder. We had no idea that Fifth Edition would become what it became. Going back and studying your career, it's really fascinating just from a historical point of view to see you right in the middle of that kind of epoch-changing moment.

**James:** It was such a time. 5E, for a lot of different reasons, has really grown the hobby in a huge and wonderful way. It's made things more accessible for creators. There probably isn't an MCDM without the number of people who wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons because of the boom of 5E, leading them to come to YouTube to search "how do I become a dungeon master," leading them to find Matt Colville.

Part of that is the slower release strategy that accompanied 5E. Part of that is Stranger Things - something outside that nobody really understood was going to have an impact on D&D the way it did. Critical Role too - all this kind of stuff. The rise of Critical Role can sort of directly be traced to the Witch Hunter movie, which no one ever talks about. I'm a big Vin Diesel fan, so I was there for that.

One thing that made Critical Role more popular was that it was already kind of popular, and then they put out this D&D Diesel promotional video where it was like, "Hey, who was that dungeon master and who were those people playing with Vin Diesel? Oh, you can see them play more D&D!" That helped things.

There's all of these different elements, this confluence of events. Largely, also the rise of internet video allowing people to just see how a game that was hard to explain to people who had never experienced an RPG before. Now you could just say, "Here, watch this clip. That's what D&D is," and people would be like, "Oh, okay! That thing they played at the beginning of Stranger Things. Alright, I know what D&D is." The landscape really has changed a lot and happened in the 5E era, and maybe a little bit because of 5E.

**Host:** The transition from 4E to 5E was something I kind of missed because at that time in my life, I was playing tabletop games but I wasn't playing D&D. It wasn't because I didn't want to, but I was in college and was so broke I could not afford anything. I wanted to play D&D, but I went to the bookstore and was looking at the fourth edition books, and they were too expensive for me. There were so many - I remember being really intimidated by that.

I didn't have my old books because me and all my brothers shared books growing up, and I just didn't get them. One of my other brothers had all of the books. I started making my own game - I decided I wanted to run tabletop fantasy games, but I couldn't afford books, so I'll just make my own. I made my own and ran it for my friends, and we played a lot. Because of that, I was not plugged into D&D.

Going back to that time period where I was thinking about all of these high-minded design questions at the same time you were talking about all the same questions in connection to the release of this new edition - it's been really fun for me to go back to that time period.

I forgot to thank you on behalf of me and all the people at the Manifold Creator Collective. We thank you and MCDM for taking the time to talk to us about all of these things. We really appreciate it.

**James:** Absolutely. Thank you for having me on. I appreciate it.

## Three Stages of James' Career

**Host:** Here's what I did: I went through and studied your career, mostly focused on the very early parts of it. I tried as best as I could to read and listen to everything that you created that I could get my hands on from 2014 till about mid-2016.

Doing all of that, I got a perception of your career where I think of it as going in three phases - maybe you don't think of it this way. There's the kind of podcast phase where you were primarily blogging on your personal blog, the World Builder Blog, and you were releasing podcasts which were primarily the Round Table podcast on the To Show, but you had many others.

Then that kind of led to a freelance design career where you were mostly making your own products which you sold on the DM's Guild, but also working as a freelancer for Wizards of the Coast. You got to work with a lot of what are now defining products in fifth edition and also defining personalities of that era. Of course, you now work with Matt Colville, but you also worked with Matt Mercer on products and with Chris Perkins.

**James:** Yeah, I worked with Chris on a couple products. The first WotC official hardcover I worked on with Chris was Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.

**Host:** So that was your freelance career, and then of course you got hired full-time as a line developer for MCDM. That's what I consider the third part - your full-time, no longer freelance design work for MCDM.

It would be fun to cover all of these periods of your career, but the one I'm really interested in for this interview is that early podcast portion and the early part of your freelance work. I guess that's the one that overlaps with the Manifold Creator Collective and me - we're all in that portion of our careers, if we ever end up having careers. And it's also the beginning of 5E, just like we're in the beginning of the Draw Steel era. So those are mostly the parts that I'll be asking questions about.

## How Did You Get Into TTRPGs?

**Host:** You used to have a podcast called Gamer to Gamer where you would do interviews like this where you would interview other professional designers and just kind of go over their career. You often started those questions by asking how people got into D&D. I want to add a little twist to it and ask you: how did you really get into D&D? Because there's a difference between people who played D&D when they had spare time in the summer with their friends at school, and people that were doing what you were doing - which is you had, I believe, multiple campaigns that went level 1 to 30 in fourth edition. That is more than most people are able to play D&D. So how did you get into D&D, and how did you really get into it?

**James:** My getting into story is so prototypical. I'm the youngest of three children, and I had an older brother who played. I remember sitting on our basement steps watching him and his friends play because, of course, I wasn't allowed to play, but they were like, "If you sit over there and you're quiet, you can watch us." I remember watching it - I was at the time maybe eight or nine years old - and thinking, "Oh my God, this is what I've always wanted!"

I remember being a kid and playing Super Mario and thinking, "Why is Mario limited to the things that he can do in the game? Why can't Mario grab this turtle shell and surf on it to get to the end of the level faster?"

**Host:** Fascinating. So you were wanting to design games from the very beginning of playing games. You had that kind of design mindset.

**James:** Yes, and that idea of "Why can't I do the things in this that I can do in real life? What is preventing me from being able to do that?" Being a kid, I didn't really understand that there were technological limitations that prevent you from it, and you should just be glad you're able to do what can be done right now.

Watching board games, even they had those limitations. Like, "Why is it when I play Candyland that I'm limited to these move sets and I can't do these other things?" So watching D&D and seeing a player say they want to do something and then they get to do it - that to me just blew my mind, that there was a game like that.

I also loved The Hobbit and all things fantasy. I used to play knights and that sort of thing. I thought, "This is amazing, this is the game that I want to play."

Then one day, some of my brother's friends didn't show up to play, and the friends who did show up wanted to play. I got to sit in because they needed a cleric. It was very much a "sit here, roll this die when we tell you to" kind of thing. I basically did what I was told, but I did have some leeway to play around, and I was hooked from then on.

I had another friend over who also filled in a role, and he went home and told his dad. His dad said, "It's interesting that you guys like that. It was second edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons at the time. I have this game that I played in college that's similar." He pulled out The Fantasy Trip, which is a precursor to GURPS made by Steve Jackson.

Then from third grade through sixth grade, we were playing that all the time. Every day in the summer we would play it. We would play it on weekends, at nights, after school, whenever we could. We played it all the time, basically until Third Edition came out in 2000.

We met some new friends because we had moved to middle school, and those middle school friends were like, "Oh, we play this," so we tried that and thought, "This is great too!" So we started playing Third Edition.

From then on, I've basically never stopped playing, thinking about, or reading books as they come out for D&D. I've always been involved in some sort of game or putting together a game. If not D&D, then another RPG.

I remember in high school, we started thinking, "We've played The Fantasy Trip, we've played a couple different editions of D&D - what else is out there? Oh, there's a Star Wars roleplaying game. We love Star Wars, let's try that!" We played the West End Games 2D6 system.

In 8th grade, I wrote a hack of The Fantasy Trip with one of my friends that was like a modern spy thing, because we were very into James Bond movies and playing Metal Gear Solid. That was my first real foray into game design - I hacked that game, and my friends and I played this spy game for a long time, like two years. We were creating talents and stuff like that. I wish I still had it - it's on a hard drive of an old Macintosh computer somewhere. It was super fun to be able to do that kind of stuff.

That's how I got started playing, and I've been hooked ever since.

In terms of my modern era of really starting to play - I lived basically in the same place my whole life. I lived in New Jersey, and eventually I got a job in Atlanta working for Adult Swim after college. I didn't know anybody. I moved to Atlanta without any friends or anything like that, and I wanted to make friends. So I started going to a local game store down there called Raven's Nest in Decatur, Georgia, right outside of Atlanta, and I made tons of friends.

I didn't have any other commitments. Back home in Jersey, I had other friends, I had family, but I also had organizations I belonged to - I did a ton of theater. In Atlanta, I had nothing, so I was going to the game shop and playing three or four times a week. I was like, "Oh, this is what I've always wanted to do!" Then I just kept it up from there. No matter where I moved, I always made sure that I had multiple groups and was always playing as much as I could.
